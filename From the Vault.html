    <p> <strong> <center> Fireball. Cast only fireball. JUST FIREBALL. <center> </strong> </p> <br/>
    <p> <em> Filbert's notes</em>: 'Ah yes. Fireball. the most infamous and widely used spells in all arcanium. Deadly to both friend and foe. Just don't use it close quarters. <br/>
        Yes. Fireball is argubly the most famous and powerful spell in all of Dungeons & Dragons 5E. But was it always like that? Let's tap one and a blue and 'time walk' 
        back to the orginal rules. </p>
 <p> Spell Level 3 <br/>
Duration 1 turn <br/>
Range 24" <br/
A missile which springs from the finger of the Magic-User. 
It explodes with a burst radius of 2" (slightly larger than specified in CHAINMAIL). 
In a confined space the Fire Ball will generally conform to the shape of the space (elongate or whatever). 
The damage caused by the missile will be in proportion to the level of its user. 
A 6th level Magic-User throws a 6-die missile, a 7th a 7-die missile, and so on. <p>
    
Indeed, fireball used to be a very different beast. Instead of being classed as an outright spell-it was considered a 'Missile' right up until 2E
which meant it could largely be cast at will. Not only that; but it interacted with it's environent in a far more destructive way, expanding to fit environments 
and even having a pressure element applied to it. <br/>
Didn't think it was possible for ot to be more overpowered, did you? well-2nd edition expands on this even further. although it became a 'leveled spell', 
    fireball itself evolved to expand to fit it's environment, meaning it would be devastating in narrow mines and caves. To top it all off, it had a range slider to make it even more versatile. <br/>
    At third edition, things start getting more streamlined. gone are the pressure and expansion rules; making it a bit more balanced. </br>
we don't talk about 4E for obvious reasons, but here it was very strange. reclassed as a 5th level 'Daily attack power', gone is its power based on the caster's level, 
    sticking to flat damage with no upcasting options. <br/>
Finally we reach 5th Edition; where fireball took on the 'non-caster level based' element and base dame of 4E's spell, 
    but made it a 3rd-level spell with the option to upcast. Fantastic. Wizards have never cast a differet spell ever since. </p>
