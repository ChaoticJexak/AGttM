 <p> <strong> <center> Character backstories </center></strong> </p>
<p> The backstory is a Pivotal part of a good character, and by extension an enjoyable roleplay experiences. 
    Therefore it is important to build that story correctly; not only for your own sake, but for your fellow players and Gamemasters' as well.
    There are several pitfalls one can fall into when writing a backstory, the most common of which adding simply too much content-especially for a charater starting at level 1. 
    Often I see epic stories unfolding over multiple pages of a character who has gone through hell to be where they currently are; which simply does not make sense.
    Not only that, but no GM worth their salt is going to want to read half a novel just to work your character into thier world. 
    Speaking of, too much can make it significantly harder to weave your PC into the story. <br/> </P>
        
        
    <p> A character backstory should consist of the following key points </p> <ol>
    <li> A visual description of the character </li>
    <li> Thier personality, virtues, and flaws </li>
    <li> the important elements of thier origin/childhood </li>
    <li> Thier desires, goals, likes, and dislikes </li>
    <li> The reasons why they are the class/background they are-and any tool skills they might have (some systems have this as a mechanic) </li>
    <li> A nemesis or three, and maybe a few allies or affiliated factions (consult your GM about this) </li>
    </ol> 
    <p> Remember that you can draw inspiration from anywhere; from the works of Tolkien to your favourite video-game character. Make your character compelling,
    give them a reason of be a part of the adventure. You will find that by fleshing out your character will help you get valuable inspiration points (if your system uses them),
    as well as organicly knit you into the party.
        </p>
