        <strong> <p> Latest Article </strong> </p>
 <p>In <em> this issue </em> of <strong>Tavern Thoughts</strong> we turn our scrying orb to the 8  standard schools of magic used in most sytems. <br/>
<li?>These of course consist of: 
<ul>

<li> Divination: the art of magical vision, finding, and looking though time itself </li>
<li>Conjuration: Summoning creatures and objects, sometimes from other planes or realities</li>
<li>Evocation: spells with an instant effect; often elemental and usually combative</li>
<li>Transmutation: turns things into other things</li>
<li>Abjuration: block, banish, or protect with this spells! often divine magic</li>
<li>Necromancy: resurrection, revival, and reventants!</li>
<li>Illusion: make living entities see,hear,ect things that are not there</li>
    <li>Enchantment: Buff yourself, allies, or even items with magical power</li> <br/> </P>
<p>
But we aren't here to ponder the facts, we are Gamemasters and Worldbuilders! As thus we can take a compresive look at how these laylines function, and from there how to build our own spells. 
</p>
<p>
The first point to consider is what function we want our spell to have. 
    Perhaps we want our players/NPC's to shoot lightning from their hands, 
    or create insect life from coins. From there we decide 
    where in the 8 schools the spell may be placed 
    (or perhaps engineer our own system-a topic to be discussed in a future Tavern Thoughts). 
    Or perhaps you want the spell to intentionally meld into two or more schools- 
    such as an enchantment spell that allows an item you touch to cast 'Fire bolt' automatically when touched.
    In these cases you may attribute either or the primary school for such spells. <br/> </p>
    
    <p> Our second point should be the flavour. How do we want the spell to look when cast? what should the 
        spellcaster be required to do to succeed in casting? what materials does it demand? 
        all these questions can be answered however you like; by either adhering or subverting from the expectations set in the core rules of your chosen setting.
        As an example, The spell <a href "https://www.worldanvil.com/w/old-zenithas-chaoticjexak/a/channel-demonfire-article"> Channel Demonfire </a> Requires the caster to 'make a sweeping wave motion with their arm, ending with a claw like grab at the air. 
        Also requires an incantation'; and manifests as 'a sickly green wave of burning hot spectral fire, that sizzles and pops'. What seems to be pure flavour 
        can be crucial to the next step. <br/>
        Other detials may or may not be important to you as a brewer, such as who invented or discovered the spell, and some history of its use
        <br/> <br/>
        
        Following the previous example; we have various factors to consider. What the spell specifically does should be in line with it's flavour and core function
        Damage-type spells may require a sving throw or attack roll (depending on system), wheras healing spells may simply require a roll to see how effective they are. <br/>
        some spells will require concentration (applicable to some systems-usually a saving throw), and often most spells will require some casting components (such as a somatic, verbal, or material requirment). <br/>
        Also important to consider is the possibility of 'ritual casting', I.E the ability to 'take time' to more easily cast the spell-and enlist help to cast spells of a level that would normally be above the caster's capabilities. <br/>
        Next to consider is the duration and casting time of the spell. This will help determine whether or not it should require concentration, and partly it's place in a spellcaster's aresnal.
        Combat and healing spells usually require a turn/action/ect, and are cast with 'instant' duration. Some spells- such as those designed to counter other magic-
        Will be cast at counter/reaction speed. <br/>
        Range! range range range. How far your spell can reach is crucial. This is a question of two parts, origin and travel. The former relates to
        how far from the caster the spell may manifest, wheras travel infers how far the spell may move or exist from the origin point-this includes circle radiuses, lines, cones, and ranged combat spells. <br/>
        With all this in mind; we can now turn our attention to the function of the spell in full, and how to convert that to a mechanical component within our chosen system.
        In this we look at the element of a spell (if it has one); The overaching function (counter, healing, buff, ect-likely related to its 'school'), and how it effects the target. <br/>
        Once again returning to the linked example; Channel Dragonfire is a spell designed to create a damaging hazard that may also inflict an additional status effect. As thus it uses a 'saving throw' damage method as opposed to an attack roll
        ,and only applies if the target(s) is on or moves into range. Due to it's flavour and purpose it deals fire-based damage. <br/>
        Finally, with all this planned out, focus can be placed on the spell's level (different systems will handle this differently). Level 
        serves as a balance in gameplay, with stronger spells locked to only higher level characters/PC's. To assist you in determining the spells level,
        Try to cross-reference with existing spells in your system. If your spell is too weak or strong, adjust the mechanical components to fit the level you wish the spell to fall under. 
        You could also add a side-effect for weaker spells, such as a lingering status effect. In the case of overpowered spells, a restriction may be in order.
        In Channel dragonfire, it is restricted so that it Can only target celetials are targets effected by the 'Burned' status effect. This is not only flavourful
        but also allows the spell to be balanced enough as a level 1 spell, despite its lingering function and respectable damage. <br/>
        <br/>
        To conclude, A spell must be: functional, flavorful, and mechanical-or F.F.M for short. <br/>
        following these three points; you will be well on your way to becoming a top tier spellcrafter. Now let's get brewing!
