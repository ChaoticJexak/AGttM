    <p> To start off this topic with a 'bang', I'd like to share an absolutely fantastic screw up from a campaign I was involved in for quite a while <br/>
    The game took place in the Dungeons & Dragons (5th edition) setting of the forgotten realms. Our party had found our way incredibly deep in a cave system after a sinkhole swallowed us all up <br/>
    We had fought our way downward through an achaic cave system, cart in tow. Goblins and other low level monsters splattered in our wake. We tussled with a lesser shadow demon, which served as our area boss. <br/>
That massive cave room happened to be adorned with a lavish golden throne. It was of course intended for intregue and decoration-but we had a cart and a transmutation wizard at hand. <br/>
    Thus we turned gold into fired clay, broke it appart, and returned the chunks to gold again, loading it into the cart. To cut a long story short; we pretty much broke waterdeep's economy once we finally got out (barely). </p>
<p> Our resident wizard bought a used 'Ring of Three Wishes', which had two embedded spells left. The first of which was spent wishing into existance a sizable keep for the party,
        to benefit from the 'Stronghold' rules first seen in 3.5E. Meanwhile; our Bard decided to buy a bunch of abandoned warehouses to create a 'shopping centre'. </br>
It should be noted that our Bard was not on good term's with Xanathar's Guild-but that is a story for another day.  </br>
        My character meanwhile (a swashbuckler rogue) was a bit more modest. taking barely any of the 10,ooo+gp share, just invested in a magical dagger and some edgy armour spikes.
